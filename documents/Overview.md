# DAO Voting System Smart Contracts

## Overview
The DAO voting system is structured using three separate smart contracts, each serving a specific purpose.

## 1. Voting Session Contract (Session Creation)
### Purpose
Manages the creation and administration of voting sessions.

### Key Functionalities
- Initiates and concludes voting sessions.
- Registers eligible voters for each session.
- Interfaces with the ERC20 Token Contract for token distribution.
- Implements access control for session management.

## 2. Voting Contract (Vote Management)
### Purpose
Handles the voting process for each session.

### Key Functionalities
- Records votes for each proposal.
- Enforces quadratic voting rules.
- Calculates and stores vote outcomes.
- Verifies voter eligibility and vote validity.

## 3. ERC20 Token Contract (Token Creation and Distribution)
### Purpose
Manages ERC20 tokens used for voting within the DAO.

### Key Functionalities
- Implements standard ERC20 functions.
- Mints and distributes tokens to voters.
- Integrates with the Voting Contract for token-based voting.

## System Workflow
1. **Voting Session Contract:** Sets up new voting sessions, registering voters, and distributing tokens.
2. **Voters:** Receive tokens and participate in voting.
3. **Voting Contract:** Manages vote casting and tallying.
4. **ERC20 Token Contract:** Provides tokens for voting and handles post-voting token processes.

## Additional Considerations
- **Security and Permissions:** Ensure secure and authorized interactions between contracts.
- **Scalability and Gas Efficiency:** Optimize for transaction volume and efficiency.
- **Transparency and Auditability:** Maintain clear processes for vote tallying and session management.
- **Upgradability:** Consider potential future enhancements and changes in the DAO.
